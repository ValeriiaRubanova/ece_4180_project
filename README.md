# Final project: ECE 4180 F22

Modern implementation of a 3D version of the arcade game “Asteroids” using mbed as a hand-held device for user input. Game graphics are displayed on a computer screen through serial port connection, additional gameplay effects, like sounds, are played on a speaker peripheral.
